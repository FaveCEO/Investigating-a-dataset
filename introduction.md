# The Movie Database(TMDb)
TMDB is a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows designed to help find something to watch.
The data for this analysis gotten from Kaggle and a cleaned version provided by Udacity contains information of about 10,000 movies including user ratings and revenue.

Before a movie can have a good rating, there must certain qualities the movie has and the viewers are looking forward to. 
Does the genre of a movie make it have a bettter rating? In terms of production how much has the production of a movie increased over the years? If a movie has a longer runtime does that mean more cost for the production company or do longer movies bore viewers giving it a lower rating? Which genre of movie has been produced overtime? Is there something particular about production companies that have made good profit overtime? Is producing a movie becoming more expensive than it was in the 90's? What genre of movie should a production company mostly like look into if it is to make profit?
These are questions my investigation would like to answer and predict given data on the budget, user ratings and revenues.

First step is to make data as clean and tidy as possible before we begin to explore.
