# Conclusion
> In the first section I examined how often a particular a particular genre of movie was produced and it turned out to be that alot of Drama movies have been produced over the years. 
>
> I also considered the Runtime of a movie, examining how thw runtime affects cost, which genre has longer runtime and what range has more popularity. From the examination, most movies do not exceed a runtime of 200 secs and which is also why movies within this range of runtime are realy popular. This examination also shows that longer runtime does not necessarily mean more cost and also does not mean a better rating since History genre has a high runtime but does not have a high rating as compared to others. This result made me particular about the History genre to know which year Historic movie started going more into production and the visualization sjows more Historic movies were produced around the year 2000-2015
>
> An examination of the vote_count for various genres showed that people prefer Sci-Fi, Action, Adventure and Fantasy as suspected. The vote_count is considered as the rating.
>
> Due to the current economic situations it was necessary to find out how the cost of produciong a movie has increased or decreased over the year and from the visualization, it actually did show an increase around 2000 but also shows a decrease and sometimes increase after year 2000 but cost has never been the same as it was in the 90's.
>
> In the last section I wanted to know what characteristics movies with high and low profit had, I guess it is quite normal that movies with high rating should have higher vote count which is why i decided to check which genre of movie has the highest profit and it showed that movies which actually had high rating had high profit indeed. 

##### LIMITATIONS
> 
> While examining the runtime, it showed some runtime recorded as 0 which should not be so. Take for example Mythica: The Necromancer which was recorded to have a runtime of 0 instead of 95 minutes and this also goes or the budget and revenue. I could have replaced this values with the mean but could affect the result.
>
> Also, in the calculation of the profit though revenue minus cost was used it wil be good to know for sure what and what was calculated to get the budget and revenue or was the budget stated exceeded or not. In terms of the popularity rating also, what factors was considered when assigning the popularity score. These are questions that if answered could give better analysis.
